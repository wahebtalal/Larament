```

###  CLI Installation

You can also use the following command to create a new project with Larament.

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist CodeWithDennis/larament example-app
```

If you don't want to remember the composer installation syntax for future projects, you can create an alias for your terminal:

```bash
alias larament="composer create-project --prefer-dist CodeWithDennis/larament"
```

This allows you to simply use `larament my-cool-app` in your terminal.

```bash
larament my-cool-app
```
